ConboJS-React example
=====================

Simple example application demonstrating how to integrate [ConboJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbo)
features into a React application, including an event bus, property injection,
commands and services.

This example uses the [Conbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbine) build 
of ConboJS, which is ConboJS with all the view classes removed, and creates
a context that is available globally via an `import`.

This approach benefits from its simplicity and requires less code than other 
approaches, as there's no properties to pass or `contextType`s to set, for
example.

To run the example, open a command line and enter:

```
npm i
npm start
```
